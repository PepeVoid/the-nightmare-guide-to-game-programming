# Where to start

If you've already read the [Cronology](../tutorial/cronology.md) you will realize how different is the programming of the first computers from today's standards.

If I had to explain to you how everything works from scratch, I would be venturing through many concepts of electricity and digital electronics that you already studied in high school and you probably don't even remember.

Long story short, we won't go over how a computer works at the electronic level. Although an interesting topic, it's a field completely away from programming that, at the moment, we are not interested in.

Nevertheless, I would recommend you to get up to date with the following concepts. They're not strictly necessary to continue, but they will be quite useful to understand the following pages:

- Boolean Algebra
- Logic gates
- Binary addition
- Carry bits
- Half adder
- Full adder
- Two's complement
- 8-bit adder
- ALU
- Registers
- Bytes and Nibbles
- Hexadecimal System
- Opcodes
