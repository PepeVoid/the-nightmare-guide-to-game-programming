# Introduction

As you may have noticed, this is unlike any programming book you have seen or read so far.

In the following sections you will find a series of information that you may not have seen in your life, or it may sound slightly familiar to you but you don't know it at all.

It is possible that you have found yourself in this situation on more than one occasion when you have tried to learn to program, and you have ended up quitting because you didnâ€™t know how to continue with the information you found.

Let me tell you a little secret about learning anything by yourself, and you will have to apply if you want to continue with this guide:

> ðŸ›ˆ Nothing not put into practice doesnâ€™t have any potential usefulness.

But Iâ€™m aware that you donâ€™t know how to apply it, and that is because all the tutorials and books that you may find are designed for you to learn with the information they give you, followed by ready-made examples that you can copy and paste to see that they, indeed, work.

That is why I have designed this guide, to help you benefit from what I just told you. I'm going to assume that you follow it sequentially, otherwise you won't learn anything and you will find yourself jumping between pages.

I'm not going to explain anything to you either, since there's no point in taking my reasoning to understand it. If you don't know what I'm talking about, you might have skipped the rule of following this guide sequentially. Please, go back to the [Preface](./preface.md) and read it if you havenâ€™t already. I know you don't want to, but it is necessary in order to continue with this not so necessary but senseless introduction.

You will find examples, but please don't copy them. Any information you might find is an extension of what you have researched on your own, or that I considered to add to help you improve your learning skills.

I can't guarantee you that everything you will learn along the way will be applied in your future jobs, but it will help you get by when facing new challenges and looking for solutions.
