# Where we come from

Something that will never cease to amaze me is that programmers program without knowing why. Don't get me wrong, I'm not talking about their motivation, or what they do for a living. I'm talking about where it comes from and everything that has had to happen so that we can write a series of characters on a notepad with a particular format, and magically do what we need.

If you talk to an artist, he will tell you that the origin of art goes back to the Paleolithic cave paintings. A musician will also agree that in prehistoric times there were manifestations of primitive musical instruments, but it wasn't until Ancient Egypt that first musical scales were used.

Now talk to a programmer, you will be surprised at the non-existent amount of answers you will find from them. The most affected in this case are those programmers who only work in high-level languages, that only do web, mobile, desktop and video game applications.

**But is it necessary to know the origin of computers, programming and computing to be able to work as a programmer?**

*An artist does not need to know that cave paintings were the first vestige of art in humanity, just as a musician does not need to know that the first human beings managed to generate the first musical rhythms by hitting two stones together.*

**So do we need to know it to program?**

*A good artist is able to draw both in digital and traditionally when is asked to. What makes him an artist are his skills, regardless the tools*

**Are you going to answer the question?**

*If I did, I would be breaking one of the main rules of this guide.*

Considering where we are coming from can be quite interesting. Academics aside, the truth is that the history of computeting is so short that can be learnt in one morning.

You can start searching at your own pace. However, since we are still in the tutorial, I will give you a little chronology to let you know if you are on the right track or if you are doing too much research:

- (5000 BC) Abacus
- (1452-1519) Leonardo Da Vinci's adding machine
- (1613) Richard Brathwait
- (1622) Slide rule
- (1623) Schickard's calculating clock
- (1642) Pascaline
- (1672) Leibniz Wheel
- (1725) Basile Bouchon
- (1728) Jean-Baptiste Falcon
- (1745) Jacques de Vaucanson
- (1786) Differential machine
- (1801) Jacquard loom
- (1834) Relay
- (1837) Analytical machine
- (1842) Ada Lovelace
- (1847) George Boole
- (1890) Tabulating machine
- (1904) Vacuum tube
- (1906) Triode
- (1936) Turing machine
- (1937) Claude Shannon
- (1944) Colossus Mark I
- (1945) Von Neumann architecture
- (1946) ENIAC
- (1946) EDVAC
- (1947) Transistor

If you have done enough research, you will realize that there are certain pieces of information that may seem unnecessary and some of the essentials to understand how a computer works are missing. As I said, the purpose of this guide is to help you learn how to learn, any advice or help you receive is just another programmer's opinion.

You may be wondering why I have decided to stop the chronology at the transistor. The truth is that there are a number of relevant dates related to the emergence of electricity, television, integrated circuits, the first generation of consoles, CP/M and DOS. They are important and we will see them in detail when necessary, but with the appearance of the transistor we have enough to build our own computer.

Don't rush to the next section, take your time until you've learned everything you need to learn.

At the same time, you must know when to stop.

Don't rush, take your time and go back whenever you need it. I encourage you to repeat until the information is well digested.

Feed back everything you have learned so you can contrast what you knew before with what you know now.
