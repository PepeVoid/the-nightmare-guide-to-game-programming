# Worrying about Hello World?

There is a ritual that all programmers have to perform when we start our adventure in a new programming language. And no, it has nothing to do with being part of a cult of programmers who worship the almighty creator of a language that has given them the blessing of being able to live financially thanks to its miraculous creation.

Hello World is a program that is used to ensure that a language is properly set up on your system displaying the phrase `Hello World!`.

Although at first seems a very obvious program without much utility, it hides many mysteries and anecdotes about its origin.

It is such a widely used program that there are pages like [The Hello World Collection](http://helloworldcollection.de/) that compile all existing Hello World programs for each programming language and its variants.

Unfortunately, it doesn't do us any good to know how to print characters across the screen, at least not at the starting point we're at.

You might hate me right now for telling you that there’s no purpose in learning the most used programming software to start programming. If that's so, please go back and refer to the [Preface](../instructions/preface.md). It’s necessary to accept that you don't know how to program.

Let me explain it with an example for you to understand:

```python
# Example of Python 3 Hello World program
print("Hello World!")
```

As you can see, you don't need to know how Python works to understand what that piece of code does. And it's true, you don't need to know how it works, but what's the point of starting to program without knowing what kind of black magic hides?

The perfect excuse is that we are just starting to program, and everyone will tell you not to worry about it, you’ll hear it from almost everyone. In my humble opinion, there are two reasons for this:

 - The first one is that they did care to know how it works underneath, but they have to follow an established syllabus that the teaching group imposes on the students so it doesn't become a complete nightmare for them.

 - The second and more common reason is that they, in fact, don’t actually know how it really works, so it’s just pure speculation until they get code properly running.

In either case, not caring about how it works can be a huge inconvenience that you've had to deal with on more than one occasion.

Start caring, it will help you survive this guide and anything else you want to learn on your own.
